			.question#What_Are_Sessions
				h3 What are Sessions and why are they important to building an app with Label Insight’s API?

			.question#What_Are_Dietary_Profiles
				h3 What are Dietary Profiles and why are they important to building an app with Label Insight’s API?

				p
					| The Label Insight Personalized Dietary Profile is key and core to the Label Insight API. All the product data that is returned via a call is customized in the profile. The profile stores what nutrients, additives, allergens, and ingredients you care about. It also stores which property is used to sort returned product data, and to base personalized recommendations on. Use the Set Profile (setprofile) and Add My Ingredient (addmyingredient) methods to update and customize your profile. Use the Get Profile (getprofile) method to retrieve your existing profile as a JSON or XML string. If one has not been set already, getprofile will provide a default profile.<br>
					| There is a detailed walk-through of the profile on our 
					a(href='http://developer.foodessentials.com/Set_Profile') Set Profile

			.question#What_Is_Product_Score
				h3 What is Product Score and why is it core to building an app with Label Insight’s API?

				p
					| The Label Insight Personalized Product Score (PPS) delivers a product score for a given product based on what an individual considers important. The PPS is designed to provide a specific user with a reference to compare products and product appropriateness to their specific needs. The Personalized Product Score therefore cannot be used to determine or rate the nutritive values of products. It only reflects the appropriateness of a product based on their Label Insight Personalized Dietary Profile The Product Score method (productscore) will return a product score number from -100 to 100 for a given UPC based on a user’s dietary profile settings. Use this to rate or compare any array of products based on the dietary profile. but can be used by developers to display results in any other related visual or alpha numeric scale.	There is a detailed walk-through of the Product Score method (productscore) on our 
					a(href='http://developer.foodessentials.com/Product_Score') Product Score page

			.question#How_Many_Products
				h3 How many U.S. products are in your database?

				p
					| Our database represents 90-95% of the products sold (sales) in the U.S. market. This is pretty much standard with all the leading databases. This does not however mean that this represents the percentage of products 
					em in 
					| the UN market as there are many specialty products that are not at this time represented in the database. The result is that for a typical national retailer we may have up to 90% of their products, but for specialty stores we could have less than 50% of their products. To counter this we offer the data collection SDK (beta). This is a data collection API which provides your users the ability to collect photos of products that are not in the database with our commitment being to digitize and make available that data as soon as possible. We have found that users get excited to contribute to the database and that their involvement in the database maintenance builds loyalty to the application.

			.question#Is_SDK_Required
				h3 Is is required to use your SDK? Are sole use of direct requests to the API allowed?

				p
					| We highly recommend the SDK as a solution and developers are having great results. It is still in beta so it is not a requirement but we have found it to increase engagement for apps that implement it. Sole use of direct requests to the API allowed.

			.question#How_Up_to_Date
				h3 How up to date is your database?

				p
					| We have the most up-to-date, accurate, and powerful database in the industry. We process up to 40,000 new or updated products every month and 90% of our products were updated in the last 12 months.

			.question#What_Requirements 
				h3 What requirements need to be met in order to subscribe to the Premium API plan?

				p

			.question#Paid_And_Free 
				h3 Can the Premium API plan be used for both paid and free apps?

				p
