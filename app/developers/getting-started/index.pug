					h1 Creating a Session
					p Here we’ll explain what a session is, why you need one, and how to create it.

					h2 What are sessions?

					p
						| A session is an ID that is acquired with the createsession method. You need a session id (sid) before trying any other end points to interact with the Label Insight API. Use the “Create Session” method to create a new session id that you can then use for all other methods.

					h2 Why do I need a session?

					p 
						| Sessions have been put in place to provide the infrastructure for future product recommendation functionality.  In order to make accurate and personalized product recommendations to help users find healthier products we need to record actions to a session.

					h2 What does a session look like?

					p
						| Using your appid you call for a session ID that will be returned as a json or xml string. The only things required are a uid, a devid, and an appid.<br>
						| Here is a break-down of every option for the call:

					h1 Setting a Profile
					p Here we’ll explain what a Label Insight Dietary Profile is and why it is key and core to using LabelAPI.

					h2 What’s a profile?

					p 
						| An API powered by Label Insight won’t just have access to all the data available on a food product’s Nutritional Information label. It will also be able to harness the power of the Label Insight Personalized Dietary Profile.  Set a profile for each user based on their concerns: (Gluten free, GMO free, low-sugar, high-fiber etc) and your app will deliver alternate choices of food products that are based on the research of our Label Insight Dataticians, our dedicated staff of data and nutrition experts.

					h2 What does a profile look like?

					p
						| You create or update a profile with an xml or json string. The first four sections set which label nutrients, Label Insight allergen & additive warnings, and which specific nutrients a user may want to track. The last section sorts the results set according to any one nutrient, additive, allergen, or ingredient selections.
