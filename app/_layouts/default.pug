//- Jade doesn't support dynamic includes so partials aren't as clean.
//- We replace some includes with mixins for that purpose.

//- Sections Array
//- id / spelled out name / url
- var sections = [{"id" : "home", "name" : "home", "url" : "/"},{"id" : "cpg", "name" : "cpg brands", "url" : "/solutions-cpg"}, {"id" : "retailers", "name" : "retailers", "url" : "/solutions-retailers"},{"id" : "smartlabel", "name" : "smartlabel", "url" : "/solutions-cpg/smartspec-smartlabel"},{"section" : "about", "name" : "about", "url" : "/about"},{"section" : "blog", "name" : "blog", "url" : "#"},{"section" : "login", "name" : "login", "url" : "#"}]
